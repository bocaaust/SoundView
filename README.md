# SoundView
An iOS app that generates sound based on RGB values for images.

##How do I use it?
Simply touch anywhere on the image, and a sound will play based on the location of your finger. Try dragging your finger or touching with multiple fingers for some cool effects!

Tap on the top left corner to open a pull-out menu. While the menu is open, you can change the image using the slider, or press the "Play" button to play the entire image as a sound. We included two color-blindness tests so that when color-blind people put their fingers over the image, they will hear a different sound when a color changes. This essentially helps color-blind people detect the difference between red and green (for red-green colorblind people) or blue and yellow (for blue-yellow colorblind people).
